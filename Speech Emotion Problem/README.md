## Speech Emotion Recognition Problem

For Speech Emotion Recognition one can use either of these: raw wave form (1d), logmelspectrum (2d), logspectrum (2d), mfcc (2d), or mixture of these.

### Approaches:
1. Training 1D and 2D CNN using Log-Specgram features of a wav file (Using Keras)
2. Training LSTM Network using Filter Bank features of a wav file (Using Keras)
3. Training 2D CNN after augentation of a wav file (Using PyTorch)
